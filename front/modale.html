            You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.

And when we woke up, we had these bodies. I don't want to be rescued. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.

Why yes! Thanks for noticing. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.
Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.

You know, I was God once. Now what? It must be wonderful. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Meh.

What are their names? So, how 'bout them Knicks? Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?
Actually, that's still true.

I'm Santa Claus! Tell them I hate them. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."

Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
